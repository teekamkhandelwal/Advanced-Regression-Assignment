## Project Objective 
Build a project in the insurance domain, similar to the project you saw in the ‘Retrieval Augmented Generation’ session. The goal of the project will be to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from various policy documents. You may use LangChain or LlamaIndex to build the generative search application.

## Document
HDFCvarious Insuracne policy documetns sotred in single folder

## Install Libraries
 Execute all cells to install the required libraries and code dependencies.

## Steps to Run the Semantic Spotter:

Mount Google Drive: Access and set the path to stored files, then read the PDFs.

Set API Keys: Configure the OPENAI_API_KEY.

Create and Index Nodes: Generate nodes from documents and store them in a vector index.

Query the Index: Develop and use query templates to retrieve indexed data.

Extract Response and Feedback: Get response details (source, filename, page, text) and gather user feedback for improvements.

## Technology used-
Python 3.10+
LlamaIndex
OpenAI
pandas

## Note: Add your OpenAI API key to the "open_api_key_11.txt" file and store the data in the defined folder or adjust the path as needed.
